                    This page contains all the different projects I have made, I'm gonna make alone or not
                    even if it's for school, work or even for my own pleasure.
                    So don't mind checking my work anytime your heart desire.

                    Don't mind contacting me too if you want to colab or if you want to make one of your idea come to life.
